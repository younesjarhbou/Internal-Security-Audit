# Internal-Security-Audit



#Executive Summary:

This internal security audit report outlines the findings, recommendations, and strategies identified during the audit of Botium Toys’ cybersecurity program. The purpose of the audit was to assess the organization's security posture, align it with industry standards and best practices, and provide mitigation recommendations for high-risk vulnerabilities. The audit team evaluated user permissions, controls, procedures, protocols, and technology across various systems, aiming to ensure compliance and improve the overall security posture of Botium Toys.

#1. Audit Scope:

The audit encompassed the entire security program at Botium Toys. It included assessments of user permissions, implemented controls, procedures, and protocols in the following systems:

Accounting
Endpoint Detection
Firewalls
Intrusion Detection System
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool
Furthermore, the audit evaluated the alignment of current practices with necessary compliance requirements and accounted for both hardware and system access.

#2. Audit Goals:

The goals of the audit were established to:

Adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)
Establish a process for compliance assurance
Enhance system controls
Implement the principle of least privilege in user credential management
Formalize policies, procedures, and playbooks
Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements
#3. Risk Assessment:

Current Assets:
The assets managed by the IT Department at Botium Toys include on-premises equipment, employee devices, management systems, software, services, internet access, internal network, vendor access, data center hosting services, data retention, storage, badge readers, and legacy systems.

Risk Description:
The audit identified inadequate asset management practices and a lack of proper controls, potentially leading to non-compliance with U.S. and international regulations and standards.

Control Best Practices:
The audit recommends dedicating resources to asset management as the first step in the NIST CSF's "Identify" function. Botium Toys should assess the impact of asset loss on business continuity and develop appropriate controls.

Risk Score:
The risk score, on a scale of 1 to 10, is 8, indicating a fairly high risk level. This assessment is based on the absence of necessary controls and non-compliance with required regulations and standards.

Additional Comments:
The potential impact from asset loss is rated as medium due to the lack of awareness regarding which assets may be lost. The likelihood of asset loss or fines resulting from non-compliance is high due to insufficient controls and non-adherence to privacy regulations and standards.

#4. Findings and Recommendations:

User Permissions:

Finding: Inconsistent user permissions across systems.
Recommendation: Implement a review and adjustment process to enforce the principle of least privilege.
Implemented Controls:

Finding: Inadequate controls in place.
Recommendation: Enhance controls in alignment with industry best practices and compliance requirements.
Procedures and Protocols:

Finding: Lack of documented procedures and protocols.
Recommendation: Develop and document procedures for all assessed systems.
Compliance Alignment:

Finding: Non-compliance with necessary requirements.
Recommendation: Conduct a thorough review to ensure alignment with relevant compliance standards.
Technology Inventory:

Finding: Incomplete hardware and system access documentation.
Recommendation: Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all technology assets and access points.
#5. Remediation Efforts and Action Plan:

The following steps are recommended to address the identified vulnerabilities and enhance Botium Toys' security posture:

Establish a cross-functional team for asset management and ensure adherence to the NIST CSF.
Conduct a thorough review of user permissions, applying the principle of least privilege.
Enhance controls across systems and ensure they align with industry standards and compliance requirements.
Develop and document procedures and protocols for all assessed systems.
Conduct a comprehensive compliance review and make necessary adjustments.
Maintain an accurate and up-to-date inventory of technology assets and access points.
#6. Conclusion:

This internal security audit has provided valuable insights into Botium Toys’ current security posture. By addressing the identified vulnerabilities, enhancing controls, aligning practices with industry standards, and adhering to compliance requirements, Botium Toys can significantly improve its cybersecurity program. The audit's recommendations are crucial for mitigating high-risk vulnerabilities and ensuring the organization's long-term security and compliance.

#7. Acknowledgments:

We extend our gratitude to the management and staff of Botium Toys for their cooperation and support throughout the audit process.
